An extremely simple Symfony 5 and Bootstrap 5 project for a friend. Nothing interesting to see here.

Steps to run:
- Install symfony binary (mainly for the dev server): `curl -sS https://get.symfony.com/cli/installer | bash`
- Install composer: https://getcomposer.org/download/`
- Step into this project's root dir and run: `composer install`.
- Run the dev server: `symfony server:start`
- Go to http://localhost:8000 (or whatever port the server uses)
